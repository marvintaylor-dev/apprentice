# apprenctice
A website to expose you to different professions and find personal mentoring

The goal of Apprentice is to connect people of all ages to someone who is an introduction to what could be the profession of great interest
to them. Young students with no belief in their abilities may reach out or have a mentor reach out to them and show them that anything is 
possible. Showing others that they are capable of more than they dream of is one of the great byproducts of Apprentice. 

The ultimate goal of Apprentice is to reduce the amount of career changes needed in order to find what you love to do.
We want you to get a taste of many different fields. Actually experience what they experience. Talk and interact with those professionals.
Get out of your usual headspace and see the world around you and who is operating in it. 

Many people choose a career out of guesswork. In fact, most of us do. Classroom exposure to subjects often times has little connection to the 
professional practice. We look to bridge that divide, give people a real sense of what they're getting into, and have them make far more
informed decisions about their future. We don't want you to spend your thirties in regret for a life missed out on.
